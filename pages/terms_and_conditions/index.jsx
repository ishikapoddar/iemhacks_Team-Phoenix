/* This is a React component that renders a set of rules and guidelines for a Codeforces/CodeChef
community. It uses the `Head` component from the `next/head` library to set the title of the page.
The component returns a set of HTML elements that display the rules and guidelines in an unordered
list format. The CSS classes are used to style the elements. Finally, the component is exported as
the default export. */
